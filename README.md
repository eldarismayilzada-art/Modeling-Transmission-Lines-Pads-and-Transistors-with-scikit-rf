PAD Extraction GUI

A graphical RF tool for extracting T-pad models from measured S-parameters.

This project provides a modern PyQt6-based GUI frontend that communicates with an existing RF backend (pads.py) to:

✔ Select two .s2p files
✔ Run PAD extraction
✔ Save generated PAD models
✔ Visualize S-parameter data using Matplotlib
✔ Provide a clean user-friendly interface

The GUI does not modify the backend logic — it simply wraps it safely and allows convenient control.
